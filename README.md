# University projects 23/24

This repository contains my coding work from 1st university year. Every folder
is devoted to different class. Folders are a bit chaotic, as they mix little
projects, with just everyday training and homeworks.

## Folder contains
- **WDP**: entry to programming - 1st sem basic C & C++ algorithms

- **java**: OOP programming - 2nd sem, creating basic projects with 
class dependencies

- **AKSO**: low level computer architecture and OS - 2nd sem,
working with C and assembly

- leetcode: pretty self-explanatory
