# Entry to Programming
This folder is divided into 3 parts:
- **mini_projects**: mini projects given as homework
- **exams**: my implementation of optimal solutions to exam's tasks,
when I was redoing them at home
- **practice+homework**: A big mess of everything, with chapters
divided to different programming techniques or data structures
